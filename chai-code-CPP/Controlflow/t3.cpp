Challenge:
A tea shop offers discounts based on the number of tea cups ordered. Write a program that checks the number of cups ordered and applies a discount:* More than 20 cups:

20% discount
Between 10 and 20 cups: 10% discount
Less than 10 cups: No discount
*/

    totalPrice = pricePerCup * cups;

    if(cups > 20){
