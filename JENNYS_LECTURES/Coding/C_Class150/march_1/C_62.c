/* strings in c 
array of characters, it is ending with null character 
datatype arrayname[size]
char Name[10];
 char take only 1 byte 
 name is containing base address of the string 2000(address of first element of the array)
 array considered as internal pointer 
 index would be 0 to size - 1 
 In last we always store null character ('\0')
we initialized the string using string literals i.e. "anand"
char name [] = { 'a','n','a','n','d', '\0'};
* in c string is not considered as datatypes like float , structure , Union etc
# string is represent as character array in c 
  format specifier for string is %s 
  we could seperate the declaration and initialization in seperate line, it is in same line 
  we can't put array name to left side of equal to operator;

  how to initialize a string at runtime 
  can use scanf , getchar, gets function ;
