/*
tree is basically a non-linear data structures
it is used to represent hierarchical representation between them ,
tree is a nudirecated graph which is acyclic 
tree goes from top to bottom 
eg. college hierarchy :
    node is used to store the information 

    path :
    sequence of conssecutive edges ;


    tree is defined a collection of elemens/ nodes which are link together 
    to simulate hierarchy 
    root node
    node
    parent node 
    child node
    non-leaf node : having at least one node ;
    link between (a) -- (b) : called edge;
    leaf node : leaf node is external node and having no child 
    ancester(parents):
    sibling : childrens of dame parents 
    degree : the number of children of that node
     A : 3
     c: 1;
     d: 1
     h: 0;

degree of tree : maximum  degree of that tree;

depth of node :length() of path from root to that node;

height of node: number in the longest path from that node to leaf 

level of node  : the distance form root to the given node ;
depth of node == level of node 

n node = (n-1) edges 



        any predecessor on the path from root to that node 
        ancester of L : A,C, G;

        1. check path from root to that node


    decendent:
        any successor node on the path 
        from that node to leaf node 
        decendent of c : G, L, M


applications :
1. A file system ;
2. routing protocols 
3. organize data for a quick search binary tree , heap tree;
